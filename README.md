- Change diplomatic relations between countries

- Adjustable global minimum hex supply, so units don't get stuck in the middle of nowhere
- Default AI can create colonies insted of just annexing everything

### Usage
Simply download the latest Release from [here](https://github.com/C0dingschmuser/SRU_Internal/releases) or from the Steam Workshop.
Extract the zip file to a place of your choice and simply run the executable. The trainer will launch as soon as the game is running.
If evereything worked, you'll see the SRU_Internal window open. Once you enter a game you'll see all available options. Have fun!

### How it works
Contrary to ordinary mods or trainers, SRU_Interal gets injected into the core game process and has access to basically everything the game has access to. This means SRU_Internal is able to directly call, edit or hook game functions. To do so, it utilizes a slight modified version of <br> [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [Kiero](https://github.com/Rebzzel/kiero) and [Minhook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook).

### Troubleshooting
Since SRU_Internal directly manipulates the game's process memory it's possible that your antivirus flags this as harmful.<br>
**That is a false positive. The Trainer is safe.** If that happens, you need to manually add an exception in your antivirus to exclude the trainer or a folder which contains the trainer. [Here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-exclusion-to-windows-security-811816c0-4dfd-af4a-47e4-c301afe13b26) is a tutorial on how to do that with Windows Defender.
